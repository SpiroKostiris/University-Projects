This project was part of an assignment that demonstrates the Vernam cipher. 

Please note that I have based my cipher off of the 7-bit Ascii table.
Meaning that there will be times when words are encrypted and letters seem to be missing, due
to the initial 32 values not being representable. However, because I saved the encrypted messageâ€™s respective values;
the program is able to decrypt the hidden message for you (check source code to understand the encrypted message was decrypted).
The second part to the program will allow you to enter any encrypted message and any valid key to decrypt this message.
