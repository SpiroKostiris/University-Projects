The elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters in k-means clustering.

The elbow method plots the value of the cost function produced by different values of k. As you know, if k increases, 
average distortion will decrease, each cluster will have fewer constituent instances, and the instances will be 
closer to their respective centroids. However, the improvements in average distortion will decline as k increases.
 
The value of k at which improvement in distortion declines the most is called the elbow, at which we should stop 
dividing the data into further clusters.

Weâ€™ll then display the categorized data using the optimum number of clusters we determined in the elbow method step.
