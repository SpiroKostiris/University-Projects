In Section 8.7.1 (pages 294-296) of the CAS textbook Cryptography and Steganography: New Algorithms and Applications, 
pseudo code is given for watermarking an image using noise diffusion. 

I have created a script to watermark a grey-level image with another binary image based on the method proposed. 
Test the function using different images working with BMP files. The program will print the host image, followed by
the watermarked image, and finally the recovered watermark.
